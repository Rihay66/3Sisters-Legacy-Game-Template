# SHADERS

This folder contains all the shader files to be used with the 3Sisters default renderers:
* QuadRenderer
* LineRenderer
* TextRenderer

You are allowed and are able to change the shader code to change the manner of how things are rendered

Hint: If you want things like post-processing, you'll have to make on your own a framebuffer that can do so. You can look into this resource on how to do so and more: https://learnopengl.com/ Thanks Joey de Vries for the awesome resource site

due note you aren't really required to use this folder for sounds, though you must be consistent with where you put your assets and must change the ```CMakeLists.txt``` file behave how you want it to behave.

**ensure to delete this file after reading**
