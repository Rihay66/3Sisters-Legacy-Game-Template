The only file extension for music that 3Sisters can load are ```.wav``` files . However if you manage to get the MP3 dependency working with OpenAL 

due note you aren't really required to use this folder for sounds, though you must be consistent with where you put your assets and must change the ```CMakeLists.txt``` file behave how you want it to behave.

**ensure to delete this file after reading**
